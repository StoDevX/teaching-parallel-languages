# To Do 

## Short Term Tasks

* Write a page (either in the repo or on the [wiki](https://github.com/StoDevX/teaching-parallel-languages/wiki) to explain how to run our Jupyter server & kernel 
  * Which server is it running on? Thing4?
  * Which directory? 
  * What command to run? What port to access it at? What to try 
  
* Develop the trapezoid problem in C++, run it in the notebook 
* Allow anyone on campus/in a list of students to log in and do the excercise 

## Goals for January

* Write the computing trapezoid in parallel excercise in C++, Rust & Chapel 
  * It should first run with a race condition problem, and then students are asked to fix it 
  * Students should be able to verify it runs faster than the sequential version 
  * Should work completely in the web with no prerequisites 
* (Bonus) Convert the [big primes excercise](https://www.stolaf.edu/people/rab/pdc/lab/mpi_primes.html) into our web platform 
* (Bonus) Write one simple CUDA excercise 
* (Bonus) Write a deployment guide for self-hosting.
